# Impact pathway for agroforestry in North Africa and the greater Sahel

The impact pathway forms a basis for planning agroforestry as an intervention within the policy domain. It also helps to form the basis for the work within the project. The impact pathway helps us to identify processes whereby actions can best attain their intended consequences. In this pathway, we identify essential interactions and the general preconditions deemed necessary to achieve desired goals of agroforestry in the greater Sahel and North Africa.  

Possible impact could be: 
1. Technology Development and Adoption Pathway 
1. Capacity Development Pathway 
1. Policy Influence Pathway


The evolving values in agroforestry, ecosystem services and sustainability discourse emphasize the interaction of instrumental (goal-oriented) and relational (social in-group) values across farm, landscape, and policy integration scales (van Noordwijk 2021). 

The efficiency of land use in terms of land sparing and sharing, ... emphasis the importance of intermediate tree cover for ecological functions (van Noordwijk 2021). 

The shift towards a social–ecological system framing, with an increasing focus on transdisciplinary approaches that connect farmer knowledge, economic analyses, and policy ambitions (van Noordwijk 2021). 

There is a need to bridge the gap between knowledge and action in environmental issues, recognizing both instrumental and relational value arguments as complementary perspectives in promoting agroforestry within plural societies (van Noordwijk 2021). 

Needs an understanding of the intricate relationships between profit-oriented actions, community-scale institutions, and planetary boundaries (van Noordwijk 2021). 

Specific interactions within and among stakeholders to improve public knowledge and decision-making processes and stimulate pressures for change. Other forces that drive and condition the political-economic context, including institutions that mediate the prospects for change, such as markets and property rights. 
… consider the potential to influence decision-makers by making clear the interconnections between food systems and human wellbeing, and of invisible externalities and social costs
… obstacles such as pushback, denial, lock-in and blockages are present

In the Sahel, farming systems exhibit low biomass production, leading to soil erosion and degradation as crop residues are used to feed livestock. Agroforestry parklands have the potential to address these challenges by supplying green fodder, complementing crop residues, providing fruits for consumption and income, and offering soil cover to reduce erosion and mitigate climate change impacts 

Agroforestry, defined as the integration of trees and woody shrubs in crop and livestock production systems, is globally recognized and promoted as an effective strategy for achieving conservation and development objectives (Miller et al. 2017). 

The most studied interventions were incentive provision to motivate farmers to plant and maintain trees on their land, and farmer capacity development. Human well‐being, particularly income and household expenditure, was the most studied outcome category for impact evaluations, followed by impacts on agricultural productivity, with minimal evidence for ecosystem services outcomes. Practices relating to the integration of crops and trees comprised more than three-quarters of the 344 studies on practices. In contrast to the intervention studies, ecosystem services was the most well‐studied practice outcome category, followed by agricultural productivity, with minimal evidence for human well‐being outcomes (Miller et al. 2017). 

Rigorous evidence on the effects of agroforestry interventions on farmers’ land remains extremely limited. This finding is especially notable given the large volume of literature documenting the uptake of specific agroforestry practices and widespread promotion of agroforestry as a strategy to advance the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Miller et al. 2017).

Agroforestry systems are prevalent across agricultural landscapes in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), providing a diverse array of products such as food, fuelwood, fiber, and fodder(Kuyah et al. 2020)
 
 products serve both household needs and income generation through sales (Kuyah et al. 2020). contributes essential ecosystem services crucial for improved livelihoods (Kuyah et al. 2020). 

Integrating trees and shrubs with crops and livestock diversifies farm and non-farm activities, establishing varied livelihood strategies (Kuyah et al. 2020). This diversification proves valuable in coping with recurring challenges like droughts, ensuring sustainability over time. The literature on agroforestry in SSA identifies major tree-based systems widely practiced and recognized for their contribution to sustainable livelihoods. These systems are multifunctional, offering a range of goods and services that support food production, health, nutrition, wood-based energy, and income, with variations based on components and landscape management (Kuyah et al. 2020). 

…has traditionally been used .. study in the 80s …  fits well with the existing typical, savannah-park landscape. Farmers in a belt reaching from Senegal to Chad have always preserved selected trees in their fields and they continue to do so as long as changing circumstances and increasing land pressure permit (Guy 1980) … development projects sites where trees were removed because they were judged by "experts" to be superfluous or obstructing heavy modern farm equipment and machinery (Guy 1980) … 
Historical use of trees … different species of trees, in different farming or grazing systems have been deliberately managed and protected by the local people as part of their way of using the land (Guy 1980)
Acacia albida fix nitrogen, lose leaves in rainy season, develop canpy in the hot season (ethnoforestry of this crop)… (Guy 1980)
Shea nut Butyrospermum parkii in in Upper Volta, and Mali, large and well-formed trees found scattered throughout farm fields, seemingly unaffected by' field boundaries, cropping patterns or different farm management practices. (Guy 1980)
Nere, Parkia bigolbosa (P. clappertoniana), Tamarind, Borassus, Run palm (Borassus aethiopum), Acacia senegal and its close relative, Acacia laeta are tree species associated with and actually limited to the low rainfall. livestock raising and herding areas north of the cultivated or cereal belt. Gum Arabic, Baobab (Adansonia digitata), Moringa oleifera, a relative newcomer, is valued for its tender leaflets used in sauces or as a salad (Guy 1980)

Agricultural extension in the Sahel has long focused on maximizing production of cash crops. There are some basic problems with this approach. Although agricultural programs have been designed for farmers to use on their own land, the farmers themselves have seldom been involved with the design. Some introduced programs are not adopted because farmers in this fragile environment focus on minimizing risk rather than maximizing production (Guy 1980)

AF can both protect and conserve or restore and produce furnisha dn provide (Guy 1980) but … Seminar participants confirmed without reservation, that these benefits are only possible if the proper social, economic and administrative framework exists. Where this framework does not exist, it must be established before agroforestry can provide its potential benefits (Guy 1980)

The Sahelians, using their own definition, place a number of activities under the heading agroforestry that stricter definitions would exclude. For this reason activities such as shade plantation, restoration of depleted farm soils, or dune stabilization are included in this section (Guy 1980)

land tenure, political, and cultural issues threaten the shea market and production processes. Land tenure security and tree usufruct arrangements do not encourage the protection and planting of shea and other native trees (Lovett and Phillips 2018)
Addressing the threats to shea parklands requires changes to international markets, innovative technologies, water and fuel economy, and the mitigation of social and political threats (Lovett and Phillips 2018)
Village-level, female-orientated technological advances in oil-seed collection and processing should be disseminated to increase local profitability and efficiency in upstream shea production (Lovett and Phillips 2018)
The Sahel faces unprecedented challenges, exacerbated by its current population of 150 million people. Endemic poverty, a demographic surge set to double the population in the next 20 years, and the presence of violent extremism have led to mass displacement, creating millions of refugees. This crisis unfolds against the backdrop of a changing climate, marked by more extreme weather events and a shift in the long-term farming prospects for both sedentary and nomadic communities. Over 30 million people, constituting a fifth of the region's population, grapple with food insecurity, highlighting the urgent and complex nature of the situation (Grist and Harvey 2017)
The climate is naturally variable, and much of the Sahel is drought-prone; in the 1970s and 1980s, lower rainfall caused drought and food crisis; higher rainfall in the 1990s improved food security. Land degradation and desertification are ongoing issues (Grist and Harvey 2017)

Landscape analysis increases evidence base vs. landscape facilitation is more action research for development, effectiveness, and efficiency equity // interface of the two = embrace uncertainty and understand the complexity (Minang et al. 2014)
